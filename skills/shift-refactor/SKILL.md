## Steps

1. If no task slug was provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, display the full task list above, followed by:

   > **Note:** Several tasks have customizable options you may set via the [Shift Workbench](https://laravelshift.com/workbench) before running.

   Then lead with this recommendation before asking the user to choose:

   > **First time?** Shift recommends starting with a curated set of safe, broadly applicable tasks: `replace-global-facades`, `adopt-common-helpers`, `remove-redundant-table-name`, `use-laravel-carbon`, `use-class-constant`, `adopt-short-arrays`, `streamline-order-methods`. Would you like to run the curated set, or choose a specific task?

   If the user accepts the curated set, use `shift-curated` as the task slug. Otherwise ask the user which single task they'd like to run.

2. Validate that the provided slug exists in the table above. If an unrecognised slug is given, tell the user and stop.

3. Check if `SHIFT_API_TOKEN` is set in the environment. If it's missing, let the user know they may generate an API token at: https://laravelshift.com/account/api-token, then ask them to provide it. Once provided, ask whether they'd like to save it to `~/.claude/settings.json` (recommended — available across all projects) or `.claude/settings.local.json` (this project only). Save it under the `env` key of whichever file they choose:
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "SHIFT_API_TOKEN": "their_token"
     }
   }
   ```
   If the target file already exists, merge the key into the existing `env` object rather than overwriting the file.

4. Determine the remote and current branch by running:
   ```bash
   git remote get-url origin
   git branch --show-current
   git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'
   ```
   Parse the remote URL to extract `owner/repo` — handle both SSH (`git@github.com:owner/repo.git`) and HTTPS (`https://github.com/owner/repo.git`) formats. Strip any trailing `.git`. Also detect the git platform (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) from the remote URL hostname, and construct the HTTPS repo URL (e.g. `https://github.com/owner/repo`).

   The third command returns the remote default branch (e.g. `main` or `master`). If it produces no output, fall back to treating `main` and `master` as default branch names.

5. Check for uncommitted changes by running:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   If there is any output, prompt the user:

   > You have uncommitted changes. Would you like to commit and push them before running this Workbench task, or continue without doing so?

   If they want to commit, ask for a commit message, stage all changes (`git add -A`), commit, and push the current branch before proceeding.

6. Build the `scs` connection string in the format `{platform}:owner/repo:branch`, where `{platform}` is `github`, `gitlab`, or `bitbucket` based on the detected remote.

7. Run the task via the API, capturing both the HTTP status code and response body:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /tmp/shift_response.json -w "%{http_code}" -X POST \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -d "api_token=$SHIFT_API_TOKEN" \
     -d "scs={platform}:owner/repo:branch" \
     -d "task={task-slug}" \
     https://laravelshift.com/api/build
   ```

8. Handle the response based on the HTTP status code:

   - **202** — Success. Parse the response body and extract `build_number`. Display this message exactly:

     > Build #{build_number} has been queued. Most Workbench tasks run within a few minutes. You may monitor its progress at: {pr_url}. Once the {pr_term} is open, you may use the `/shift:review {build_number}` command to automate the review process.

     Where `{pr_url}` is the HTTPS URL to the repository's pull requests page (`{repo_url}/pulls` for GitHub, `{repo_url}/-/merge_requests` for GitLab, `{repo_url}/pull-requests` for Bitbucket) and `{pr_term}` is "pull request" for GitHub or Bitbucket, or "merge request" for GitLab.

   - **400** — Bad code. Tell the user the slug was not recognised by Shift and to double-check the value.

   - **401** — Invalid token. Tell the user their API token was rejected. Prompt them to re-enter it, then save the new value to `.claude/settings.local.json` under `env.SHIFT_API_TOKEN` (merging into any existing file). Retry the request once with the new token.

   - **403** — Not authorised. Tell the user their account does not have access to this task (it may require a premium plan at laravelshift.com).

   - **Any other status** — Show the raw status code and response body and ask the user how they'd like to proceed.
